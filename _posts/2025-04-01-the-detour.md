# The Detour (unfinished live doc)
It’s late at night. You’re in your bed tucked nicely, but unfortunately you don’t contain the right cocktail of hormones to drift away to a different place. A place where you create the world. A place which exposes your inner thoughts. The thoughts you know you have. The ones you know you don’t want to have. And even the ones you didn’t know you wanted to have, if you’re lucky enough. 

Anyways, you’re in bed alone with your thoughts and your mind starts to wander eventually. It starts to think about the events of the day, the week. Then it begins to wonder about the counterfactuals, the what ifs. Uh oh, you're in trouble. The number of things you can think about just increased exponentially.

It’s very tempting to dwell about the what ifs. It’s probably a crucial part of how we learn and navigate life in general. There are many paths we can take. Some of them boulevards, trodden deeply and paved nicely by others who walked the same path you do now. Many of them are dirt roads, light traces of usage visible and the occasional passerby who you greet but are otherwise trekking with nothing and nobody other than yourself. And then there are the vast terrain these roads criss-cross. Undiscovered and dangerous places we’d prefer to not think about. We think it's probably not worth venturing to these places, thinking of these terrain as barren empty deserts. 

And we’d probably be right. Chances are, if there’s an oasis out there, it's probably already discovered and a nice road there exists already. Why bother, when you can stay comfortable on your boulevard. At this point, this starts to sound familiar. This is the stuff of commencement speeches and graduations. The dose of inspiration you get inoculated by at the end of things, when you can look at how far you’ve come and at fresh beginnings, to get you excited about this new odyssey you’re about to embark on.

While in both scenarios, this inoculation may leave you with the short term effects of being excited, motivated, and anxious about what's to come, it probably doesn’t give you a map of how to wander the biomes of experience. When to stay the course? When to veer onto a new path? Which path? When should I be brave enough to create these new paths? You wake up with a groggy feeling of nice feeling chemicals but probably with more questions than you started out with.

I really like this analogy with choices being paths. Roads go somewhere: our actions lead to certain outcomes. Some we may desire. We may set them as destinations. Travelling to most of these destinations is doable, but it becomes a lot harder as our journey to this destination changes where we want to end up. Roads are not just a way to get to the destination. They are also ways to get you to change your destination. If your destination is changing most of the time, does it even make sense to care so much about where we are going all the time? If we do end up reaching the destination, we often end up leaving anyways, being the dopamine fuelled novelty seeking explorers we are.

If you want to be a wanderer it’s important to have some destination in mind, even if it might change occasionally. Otherwise we walk in random directions, and tend to end up close to where we started. The purpose of a destination, for the wanderer, is not to reach it, but rather to travel to places far and wide to where they started. Is “exploration” then just travelling further away from where you started off at? Experiences can also be represented as a fractal-like structure, with new worlds being discovered at a closer glance.

As wanderers, we should also keep in mind the terrain our paths run on. As you walk, the terrain shifts beneath your feet slowly but surely. Some days, you find yourself ascending mountains—each breath becoming heavier, each step a negotiation between determination and doubt. Other times, dense forests wrap you in uncertainty, branches obscuring your vision, whispering confusion, and making you question the very purpose of your journey. Occasionally, vast deserts stretch endlessly ahead, forcing you into conversations with yourself you'd rather avoid, testing your patience and endurance through barren expanses of stagnation. And then come rivers, appearing suddenly, demanding adaptation, making you realize some transitions are unavoidable; their swift currents pulling you forward, ready or not. Even on calm plains, the seemingly comfortable familiarity might quietly lull you into complacency, until you find yourself yearning for excitement again, questioning if stillness is comfort or merely stagnation. Each terrain and obstacle isn't just part of the path—they're reflections of the journeys unfolding within you, shaping your destination as much as they shape your sense of direction.

Sometimes we may not know the consequences of our actions so clearly. We struggle to see past the bends and the bushes the road weaves into, standing where we currently are. 

There’s also this temporal aspect. Roads may have been used a lot a while ago, but not anymore for some reason. Some roads are lost to time, whispering forgotten memories. Other roads are documented and mapped carefully. If you’re lucky, you might even get to see these maps from the experiences of other travellers along the road who were kind enough to share their tips on getting to a destination. Alas, some may just want company along their journeys, which do not end where you want to end. Some may have different incentives than you to otherwise deceive you about the route you should take to your destination. And others who may have used roads outdated that are now unkempt and overgrown with weeds from disuse as travellers use other roads, either because that destination is no longer attractive or because a shorter, faster road was found. It’s probably best to get your navigational information from a variety of sources, using the Law of Large Numbers (a.k.a The Wisdom of The Crowd).

This may get you started but after a while you may start to notice a problem. You’re only travelling paved roads, visiting crowded places, and continuing onwards to similar places. This sounds similar to a caravan, a march, or a pilgrimage. There is a reason so many words exist for this idea of travelling in a group. It is because this idea is commonly found. Being part of a group is comfortable and provides safety for the individual traveller. Is this exciting? Do we even want excitement? 

We like new stuff. That hit of dopamine you get whenever you watch a new TV show instead of the one you’ve rewatched a couple times is real. This is probably part of the explore-exploit tradeoff we’ve evolved to have. The one that we use to navigate friendships and relationships. To decide if we want to take that risky career decision rather than stick to the course. Those who were too curious probably didn’t survive very long. Those who were less novelty seeking got outcompeted by the more curious. The product of this finetuning today is us.

But we don’t live in that world anymore. The risk of straying from the beaten path is no longer as high. I think it makes more sense, now more than ever, to become wanderers.

Paths connect two destinations. What constitutes a destination is somewhat fuzzy. Is a destination someplace that 
These destinations have to have some reasonably interpretable meaning.
